# 🌱 Plant Disease Detection System  

This project was developed as part of my internship conducted by **Edunet Foundation, AICTE - Internship on AI: Transformative Learning with TechSaksham**, a joint CSR initiative of **Microsoft & SAP** focusing on AI Technologies. The goal of this project is to assist farmers in identifying plant diseases using deep learning and computer vision, providing an accessible and efficient tool for early disease detection.

## 📌 **Project Overview**  

🚜 Agriculture plays a crucial role in food security, but plant diseases significantly impact crop yield and farmer income. This project leverages **deep learning** to develop a **plant disease detection system** that classifies plant leaf images into different disease categories. The system is deployed as a **Streamlit web application**, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time disease predictions along with suggested treatments.

## 🔥 **Features**  

✅ **Deep Learning Model** – Trained using CNN on a large dataset of plant diseases.  
✅ **Real-time Disease Detection** – Upload an image and get instant predictions.  
✅ **User-Friendly Web App** – Built with Streamlit for ease of access.  
✅ **Mobile Optimization** – Model converted to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.  
✅ **Multiple Disease Classification** – Supports detection of over **38 plant diseases**.
